### **Bachelors**

I studied **Computer Science and Engineering** at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Jabalpur.

* During my undergraduation, We [designed](https://github.com/tirumalnaidu/opencl-hls-cnn-accelerator){:target="_blank"} a CNN accelerator on Intel DE10 Nano FPGA.
* At some other point during my undergraduation, I did a Research Internship at the Human Computer Interaction lab (HCI), Indian Institute of Information Technology - Allahabad, where I was supervised by Prof. Anupam Agrawal.
* I was a Co-coordinator for the Photography Club - ShutterBox. I covered various technical and cultural events in the campus during 2017-2018.


Some of the classes I took
* **Computer Science:** Fundamentals of Computing (with C), Object-oriented Programming (with Java), Data Structures, Design & Analysis of Algorithm, Database Management Systems, Image Processing, Machine Learning, Computer Organization and Architecture, Introduction to Software Engineering (Agile methodologies, UML, etc), Computer Networks, Operating Systems and Language Theory.
* **Math and Science:** Differential Calculus, Integral Calculus, Engineering Mechanics, Fundamental of Robotics, Fundamentals of Electronics, Digital Electronics
* **Misc:** Effective Communication Skills, Culture and Human values, Engineering Design, Marketing Research and Analysis, Manufacturing Processes, Soft Skills, Indian Philosophy and Literature

I've also done few group based academic projects:
* We Forecasted arrivals and prices and Onions in Indian market using hybrid model of SARIMA and SVM.
* We developed "Fest management system" (backend+frontend) to maintain a wholesome fest (A typical college fest website where someone can register for events and can check their current statuses and more).
* We worked on building lower part (legs) and movement for a four-legged soccer playing robot.(This project failed during presentation, haha)


### **Non-Traditional**

I'm a strong supporter of education through MOOCs and bootcamps.

* Marketing Reserach and Analysis - IIT Roorkee, Swayam [certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fs9FRNUo6FU38GZ7omSjEvK-c_WkGQMs/view))
* Practical Machine Learnig with Tensorflow - IIT Madras, Swayam ([certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xRh1FQtjkVmhthW2E6tGnRgPb3tdj0-R/view))
* CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Stanford (Andrej Karpathy)
* CS229: Machine Learning - Stanford (Andrew Ng - Autumn 2018)
* Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python. (Fall 2016) - MITx
