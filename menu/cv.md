### **Education**


#### **Bachelors**

I studied **Computer Science and Engineering** at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Jabalpur.

* During my undergraduation, We [designed](https://github.com/tirumalnaidu/opencl-hls-cnn-accelerator){:target="_blank"} a CNN accelerator on Intel DE10 Nano FPGA.
* At some other point during my undergraduation, I did a Research Internship at the Human Computer Interaction lab (HCI), Indian Institute of Information Technology - Allahabad, where I was supervised by Prof. Anupam Agrawal.
* I was a Co-coordinator for the Photography Club - ShutterBox. I covered various technical and cultural events in the campus during 2017-2018.


Some of the classes I took
