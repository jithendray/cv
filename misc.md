When Iâ€™m not working or attending meetings, I can usually be found banging my head to metal music or watching horror movies. 
I write reviews for music albums/bands (not regularly) on [Cursed Collection](https://cursedcollection.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.


You can follow me on Lastfm ([@Jithendray](https://www.last.fm/user/Jithendray){:target="_blank"}) to see what I'm listening to:

I love tracking to stuff I watch and listen to:

- [Horror movies I watched / watching in 2022](https://letterboxd.com/jithendray/list/horror-movies-warched-in-2022/)
- [Favorite black metal albums - 2021](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/doomedripper/black-metal-2021/)
