title: About me
---

Hi, I work as a data engineer at [NeenOpal Inc.](https://www.neenopal.com/), where I develop cloud-based data warehousing and ETL solutions for multinational clients across numerous industries.


Prior to this, I completed my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing.


In my free time, I write about metal music on my second site, "[Cursed Collection](https://cursedcollection.github.io)".
