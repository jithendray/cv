I'm currently working as a Data Engineer at [NeenOpal Inc.](https://www.neenopal.com/), where I am developing a data warehousing & business intelligence solution for one of the largest multinational logistics and transportation company in Sri Lanka.


I joined NeenOpal after graduating with a Bachelors in Computer Science from [IIITDMJ](https://www.iiitdmj.ac.in/) in India. During my bachelors, I did a few intenships, inclusing a six month stint at [NeenOpal Inc.](https://www.neenopal.com/) as a Data Scientist Intern after which I have received full-time offer. During my internship, I built a forecasting model to predict store and SKU level(500+ stores and 1000+ SKUs) sales and inventory for one of the largest Tiles producers in Sri Lanka. 

During my bachelors, I have also worked as research assistant on a project where we designed a <a href="https://github.com/tirumalnaidu/opencl-hls-cnn-accelerator" target="_blank">CNN accelerator</a> for Darknet Reference Model on Intel Cyclone V SoC FPGA.


In my spare time I enjoy working on side projects and reading. On this blog I write about projects I'm working on as well as general topics I'm interested in. I usually write code in Python, PySpark and SQL, but I've used different languages like java script, R and Java. I am interested in designing machine learning and data systems, data engineering and devops.  


I always enjoy a good conversation, so feel free to drop an email to `jithendray[at]gmail[dot]com` or DM me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/doomedripper){:target="_blank"}. Iâ€™m also on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jithendrabsy/){:target="_blank"} if you are into that sort of thing.
