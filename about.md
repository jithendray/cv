## About

Hey, My  name is Jithendra. I am currently working as a **Data Engineer** at **NeenOpal Inc.**, where we create cloud-based data warehousing and business intelligence solutions for international clients operating in a variety of sectors.

I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIIT Jabalpur](http://cse.iiitdmj.ac.in/) where I was co-coordinator for the Photography club and was responsible for event covering for various cultural and technical fests.


I spend the most of my time looking at screen. I typically spend the day writing code and attending meetings. I take some time out at night to learn stuff I'm passionate about. I like to experiment with the latest technologies and as part of this blog post, I document my learnings in software and data engineering as I go.

See my [CV](https://jithendray.github.io/cv) to get more info of me.


I spend a lot of my free time listening to metal music. I also have a second blog, [Cursed Collection](https://cursedcollection.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, where I write about metal bands and albums. I keep track of my Spotify and Bandcamp listening history using [Lastfm](https://www.last.fm/user/Jithendray){:target="_blank"}. To track my Spotify history, I also use [stats.fm](https://stats.fm/doomedripper){:target="_blank"}.
