### About

Hello and welcome to my personal website! I'm a data engineer who is passionate about solving real-world problems. As a Data Engineer at NeenOpal Inc., I design and develop cloud-based data warehousing and business intelligence solutions for clients across diverse sectors globally. I've been working on end-to-end projects that involved data cleaning, migration, visualization, forecasting, analysis, and business intelligence. I have served clients in a range of industries such as Logistics, Ed-Tech, and NBFC, delivering tailored solutions to meet their specific business needs.

I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from IIIT Jabalpur. In addition to my work, I also love documenting my learnings in software and data engineering. I have a [blog](https://jithendray.github.io/) where I share my insights and experiences, so feel free to check it out! My [CV](https://jithendray.github.io/cv) is also available for those who want to learn more about my professional background.

When I'm not working, I spend a lot of my free time listening to metal music. I have a second blog, [Cursed Collection](https://cursedcollection.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, where I write about my favorite metal bands and albums. I use [Lastfm](https://www.last.fm/user/Jithendray){:target="_blank"} to keep track of my Spotify and Bandcamp listening history, and [stats.fm](https://stats.fm/doomedripper){:target="_blank"} to specifically track my Spotify listening trends.

I am a friendly person who loves to meet new people, so don't hesitate to reach out to me! I would love to chat and hear your thoughts on software, data engineering, metal music or anything else that interests you. Let's connect!
