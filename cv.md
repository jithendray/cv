- Collaborated with data and BI engineers to develop E2E Business Intelligence solution, which included
	- Setup of Data warehouse from scratch on AWS Redshift for 6 different business units of the client
	- Configuring ETL Pipelines for Migration of data from 8 different sources (like SAP ECC 6.0, 3rd Party Data Sources, Manual Excel Files, etc.) to Redshift using Python, S3, PySpark, AWS Glue & Lambda
	- Trigger Refresh of data in the 50+ PowerBI dashboards developed as part of the project
- Implemented sanity checks for manual files before migrating them to the warehouse, reducing the human effort by 50%
- Developed complex SQL queries to transform raw tables into insightful data for powering dashboards
- Improved automation of ETL processes over millions of rows of data, saving up to 30 hours per month
- Led many requirement-gathering meetings with the client's business and technical teams from various departments to better understand the data, and assisted them in developing 4 new logistic KPIs


**End-to-End Business Intelligence Implementation for an Edtech Company**

- Led a team of 2 Data Engineers for the development of ETL jobs for migration of 500 GB of data per month from Aurora PostgreSQL to Redshift using AWS Glue
- Implemented ETL job failure triggers with EventBridge, SNS, and Lambda, which boosted the monitoring process
- Responsible for continuous QC and Performance Monitoring of the ETL jobs and timely resolution in case of any errors



#### **Data Scientist Intern, NeenOpal Inc., Nov 2020 - May 2021**

**Demand Forecasting and Inventory management for a Tiles Manufacturing Company**

### **Projects**
See here for complete list of my projects - [Portfolio](https://jithendray.github.io/portfolio/){:target="_blank"}


#### **FPGA Neural Network Accelerator**
[[github](https://github.com/tirumalnaidu/opencl-hls-cnn-accelerator){:target="_blank"}]


Designed a Neural Network Accelerator for Darknet Reference Model (which is 2.9 times faster than AlexNet and attains the same top-1 and top-5 performance as AlexNet but with 1/10th the parameters) for image classification on Imagenet Dataset on Intel Cyclone V Soc FPGA, while working as a part-time undergrad researcher under guidance of [Prof. Vinod Kumar Jain](https://sites.google.com/view/dr-vinod-kumar-jain/home?authuser=0){:target="_blank"}. When connected to ARM Cortex A9 processor using OpenCL framework, it achieved around 300% faster inference speed than CPU.

#### **AWS SageMaker - Fraud Detection**
[[github](https://github.com/jithendray/aws-SageMaker-fraud-detection){:target="_blank"}]


The goal of this project is to underdstand the complete machine learning work flow (from data collection, data storing, data preprocessing, model selection, training and finally to model deployement) using AWS SageMaker. I built an end to end fraud detection service system using services provided by AWS. Trained machine learning job and deployed model using SageMaker, created endpoint that can be invoked by Lambda, created API with API Gateway in order to send request to flask application. Deployed the application on AWS Cloud9 environment and finally integrated the application with SNS service to alert client by sending email when fraud is detected.



#### **Heartbeat anomaly detection**
[[github](https://github.com/jithendray/mini--projects/tree/main/heart-ECG-anomaly-detection){:target="_blank"}]
[[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/jithendray/mini-projects/blob/main/heart-ECG-anomaly-detection/AutoEncoder_AnomalyDetection.ipynb){:target="_blank"}]


Detected anomalies in heartbeats using LSTM Auto-encoder. The dataset used contains 5000 time series sequences with 140 timestamps obtained with ECG and corresponds to heartbeats from a single patient. Trained and evaluated autoencoder, chose a threshold for anomaly detection and finally classified unseen examples as normal or anomaly.



#### **Forecasting Air pollution**
[[github](https://github.com/jithendray/forecasting-air-pollution){:target="_blank"}]


In this project, I explored various models for forecasting time series. I then compared the performance of the models over two different metrics. I forecasted the amount of pollution in air based on the historical pollution data. I used Beijing pollution public dataset - which contains data from 2010-14, along with extra weather features such as temperature, windspeed, pressure etc.




#### **Buy or Sell Stocks? - Dual Moving Average Crossover (DMAC) trading strategy**
[[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/jithendray/mini-projects/blob/main/buy-or-sell-stocks/MARUTI_DMAC.ipynb){:target="_blank"}]


Predicted when to buy or sell stocks using simple dual moving average crossover strategy. And then backtested it over 5 years of stock. I used Yahoo! finance data downloader to download the stocks of Maruti Suzuki (MARUTI.NS). A return of 113% in 5 years estimated by DMAC strategy with short and long windows 13 and 48 respectively. However - It is up to the trader to choose the number of days to which the two moving averages are set. This should be done after testing and evaluating the system thoroughly in the recommended way, using the traderâ€™s method.

I've also done few group based academic projects:
* We Forecasted arrivals and prices and Onions in Indian market using hybrid model of SARIMA and SVM.
* We developed "Fest management system" (backend+frontend) to maintain a wholesome fest (A typical college fest website where someone can register for events and can check their current statuses and more).
* We worked on building lower part (legs) and movement for a four-legged soccer playing robot.(This project failed during presentation, haha)
