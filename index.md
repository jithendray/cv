Hi, My  name is Jithendra. I am a data engineer with experience designing data warehouses, building scalable data pipelines, data analysis, and forecasting time series.

I am currently working as a **Data Engineer** at **NeenOpal Inc.**, where I create cloud-based data warehousing and ETL solutions for international clients operating in a variety of sectors.

<!--
Projects I worked on include:
- Enterprise wide Data Warehousing and ETL solution for a Large Multinational Logistics Company
- End-to-End Business Intelligence Implementation for an Edtech Company
- Demand Forecasting and Inventory management for a Tiles Manufacturing Company
- Marketing and Recovery Officer scoring project for a leading NBFC client-->


<!--Prior to this, I completed my bachelors in Computer Science at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing - Jabalpur.-->

I spend the most of my day looking at screen. I typically spend the day writing code and attending meetings. I take some time out at night to work on the topics I'm passionate about. On [my blog](https://jithendray.github.io/posts/), I discuss data and software engineering. I occasionally develop POC projects for myself. You can view my projects on [my portfolio](http://jithendray.github.io/portfolio).


I listen to a lot of metal music in my spare time. I also write about metal bands and albums on my second blog, [Cursed Collection](https://cursedcollection.github.io/). I keep track of my Spotify and Bandcamp listening history using [Lastfm](https://www.last.fm/user/Jithendray). To track my Spotify history, I also use [stats.fm](https://stats.fm/doomedripper).

 
<!--I am currently building a habit of reading. I track my reading on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94896307-jithendra-yenugula).-->
