Hi, My  name is Jithendra. I am a Data Engineer with industry experiences in developing scalable data pipelines, desigining data warehouses, and time series forecasting. 

I am currently a **Data Engineer** at **NeenOpal Inc.**, where I'm developing cloud-based data warehousing and ETL solutions for global clients operating in diverse industries.

<!--
Projects I worked on include:
- Enterprise wide Data Warehousing and ETL solution for a Large Multinational Logistics Company
- End-to-End Business Intelligence Implementation for an Edtech Company
- Demand Forecasting and Inventory management for a Tiles Manufacturing Company
- Marketing and Recovery Officer scoring project for a leading NBFC client-->


<!--Prior to this, I completed my bachelors in Computer Science at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing - Jabalpur.-->

Most my day is spent staring at a screen. During the day, I am usually writing code and attending meetings.

At night, I take some time off to work on things I'm passionate about. I write about data and software engineering on [my blog](https://jithendray.github.io/blog/). Sometimes, I create personal POC projects. You can take a look of my projects on [my portfolio](http://jithendray.github.io/portfolio).


In my free time, I listen to lots of metal music. I also have a second blog "[Cursed Collection](https://cursedcollection.github.io/)", where I write about metal albums and bands. I use [Lastfm](https://www.last.fm/user/Jithendray) to track my Spotify & Bandcamp listening history. I also [stats.fm](https://stats.fm/doomedripper) to track my spotify history.

 
I am currently building a habit of reading. I track my reading on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94896307-jithendra-yenugula).
