👋 Hi, I'm Jithendra, and welcome to my site.

🇮🇳 I'm based in India.

👨‍💻 I am currently working as a **Data Engineer** at **NeenOpal Inc.**, where we create cloud-based data warehousing and business intelligence solutions for international clients operating in a variety of sectors.

🎓 I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from [IIIT Jabalpur](http://cse.iiitdmj.ac.in/).

📋 See my [CV](https://jithendray.github.io/cv) to get more info of me.

✍️ I document my learnings in software and data engineering as I go on my [blog](https://jithendray.github.io/blog.html)

I spend a lot of my free time listening to metal music. I also have a second blog, [Cursed Collection](https://cursedcollection.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, where I write about metal bands and albums. I keep track of my Spotify and Bandcamp listening history using [Lastfm](https://www.last.fm/user/Jithendray){:target="_blank"}. To track my Spotify history, I also use [stats.fm](https://stats.fm/doomedripper){:target="_blank"}.
